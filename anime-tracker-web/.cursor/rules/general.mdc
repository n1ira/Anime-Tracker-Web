- We are building an Anime Tracker for Web
- Find the steps in [project-steps.md](mdc:project-steps.md)
- Work on whatever step(s) I tell you to work on and only work on those steps at once
- Once those steps are done mark as completed, then stop and wait for further instructions
- Your commands are using CMD, not PowerShell
- We are using Next.js 15.2.1-canary.0
- The page needs to be in dark mode
- The old Python version which this app is based on is in [anime_tracker.py](mdc:anime_tracker.py)
